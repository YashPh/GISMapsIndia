# GISMapsIndia
An open-source repository of GeoJSON and Shapefiles providing multiple types of political maps of India and the world. This dataset ensures all international and domestic boundaries are depicted as recognized by the Government of India. A reliable resource for developers, researchers and cartographers.

## About The Project
Many global map datasets do not align with the official cartographic standards of India. This project was created to provide a reliable and accessible source of geospatial data that accurately reflects the boundaries recognized by the Government of India. The base layers for these maps are derived from the public domain [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) dataset and have been modified to align with these standards.

This repository provides multiple types of political maps for both India and the world:

- **Maps of India:** Includes national political maps with detailed and accurate boundaries.
* **World Maps:** Global political maps where all international boundaries are depicted in accordance with India's official stance.
+ **Multiple Formats:** All data is available in both GeoJSON and Shapefile formats for broad compatibility.

The primary goal is to offer a go-to resource for anyone needing accurate and official geospatial data.

## Getting Started
You can use this data in your projects in a couple of ways:
1. **Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/YashPh/GISMapsIndia.git
```
2. **Download Directly:** Navigate to the desired file and click the "Download" button on GitHub.

### Usage
The files are ready to be used in most GIS software and web mapping libraries:

- **Desktop GIS:** QGIS, ArcGIS
* **Web Libraries:** Leaflet.js, Mapbox GL JS, OpenLayers
+ **Data Science:** GeoPandas in Python
